## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS (I have used partials for the first time)
- Parcell
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

SASS:
- I have added Parcel for compiling the project.
- I have tried to use partials for the first time.

Deployed in the cloud thanks to Cloudflare.
The live solution is also running under my own domain. 

### Continued development

Sink myself deeper to the sass world.

### Useful resources

- [Sass with auto-refresh (and more) made easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYWf2m_yzBQ) - Kevin Powell's video about how to set up parcel in the project and watch SASS files.
- [Stop using @import with Sass | @use and @forward explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0) - how to use partials in SASS using @use and @forward instead of @import that is deprecated.
